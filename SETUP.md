## Environment Requirements

Before setting up, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+

Similar operating systems and software versions may also work.

## Install

Set up the environment by changing directory (cd) into the source code folder and running:

```shell
$ ./install.sh
```

This command executes the install.sh script, which automates the installation of all the necessary Python and Node.js dependencies. Once the script completes its execution, it will have configured your environment with all the necessary dependencies, making it ready for running.

## Verification

The motivating example is included in the repository. To verify that your environment is set up correctly, run a test script on the motivating example.

You'll find a sample command in the run.sh file. Please modify this command as necessary to align with your environment configuration
